# Grundig60

Converting an old radio from the 60ties (Grundig typ 92) into a DAB radio.

See [wiki](https://github.com/teuler/Grundig60/wiki) for details (German only, sorry).

### Release Notes

* 2016-12-30 - First "finale" version of the software.
* 2016-12-14 - Implemented a procedure for DAB autoseek, including (German) instructions on the OLED display. Partially solved the problem with the high sensitivity of the station dial; this fix prevents the radio from jumping back and forth between stations.
