# Grundig60

Converting an old radio from the 60ties (Grundig typ 92) into a DAB radio.

See [wiki](https://github.com/teuler/Grundig60/wiki) for details (German only, sorry).

### Release Notes

* 2017-06-07 - Added [reference](https://github.com/teuler/Grundig60/wiki) to a short presentation of the radio as Community Project in the German Make-Magzin 02/2017.
* 2017-05-07 - Added a work-around for the problem that when too many stations are found, the radio tends to oscillate between stations due to the sensitve (capacitative) station dial. Now the "Ton" dial can be used to "clamp" the selected station (for details, see [wiki](https://github.com/teuler/Grundig60/wiki/Endzustand)).
* 2016-12-30 - First "finale" version of the software.
* 2016-12-14 - Implemented a procedure for DAB autoseek, including (German) instructions on the OLED display. Partially solved the problem with the high sensitivity of the station dial; this fix prevents the radio from jumping back and forth between stations.
